The universe speaks in many languages but only one voice. The language is not. Narn or. Human or. Centauri or. Gaim or. Minbari. It speaks in the language of strength and the language of the heart and the language of trust. It speaks in the language of the soul. But always it is the same voice. It is the language of trust. It speaks in the language of compassion. It is the darkness of the soul that has lost its way. The war we fight is not against powers and principalities  it is against chaos and despair. Greater than the death of hope the death of flesh is the death of dreams. Against this peril we can never surrender. The future is all around us waiting.
